                The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government
                researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were
                large and immobile and in order to make use of information
                stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site
                of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the
                conventional postal system.
                <br /><br />
                January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the
                Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not
                have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new
                communications protocol was established called Transfer Control
                Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different
                kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each
                other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed
                to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of
                the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal
                language..

                for Universal Automatic Computer) which was delivered to the
                Census Bureau in 1951. It weighed some 16,000 pounds, used 5,000
                vacuum tubes, and could perform about 1,000 calculations per
                second. It was the first American commercial computer, as well
                as the first computer designed for business use. (Business
                computers like the UNIVAC processed data more slowly than the
                IAS-type machines, but were designed for fast input and output.)
                The first few sales were to government agencies, the A.C.
                Nielsen Company, and the Prudential Insurance Company. The first
                UNIVAC for business applications was installed at the General
                Electric Appliance Division, to do payroll, in 1954. By 1957
                Remington-Rand (which had purchased the Eckert-Mauchly Computer
                Corporation in 1950) had sold forty-six machines.

                <div class="head">TCP and UDP:</div>
                The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram
                Protocol (UDP) are used to transmit network data to and from
                server and client applications. The main difference between the
                two protocols is that TCP uses a connection-oriented transport,
                while UDP uses a connectionless type of communication. When the
                TCP protocol is used, a special connection is opened up between
                two network devices, and the channel remains open to transmit
                data until it is closed. On the other hand, a UDP transmission
                does not make a proper connection and merely broadcasts its data
                to the specified network address without any verification of
                receipt. For certain types of applications and services, a TCP
                connection makes more sense, while other types are more
                efficiently provided by UDP communication. The advantage of TCP
                is that the transmission is much more reliable because it uses
                acknowledgement packets to ensure delivery. The advantage of UDP
                is that there is no connection, so it is much faster without all
                the checks and acknowledgements going on, but is also less
                reliable. In Table some common TCP/IP applications are shown
                with the type of protocol they use.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">DNS:</div>
                TCP/IP networks communicate with hosts using their IP addresses.
                It would be very difficult for someone to have to memorize the
                different IP addresses for the hosts they want to connect to on
                the network. A Domain Name Service (DNS) makes it easier to
                identify a host by a domain name. A domain name uses words
                rather than numbers to identify Internet hosts. Suppose you want
                to connect to the CompTIA Web site by using your Web browser.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">NAT (Network Address Translation):</div>

                NAT translates one IP address to another. This can be a source
                address or a destination address. Two basic implementations of
                NAT can be used: static and dynamic
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">ICS (Internet Connection Sharing):</div>
                ICS (Internet Connection Sharing) is a built-in feature of
                Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows 2000, Windows Me, and Windows
                Xp. ICS provides networked computers with the capability to
                share a single connection to the Internet. Multiple users can
                use ICS to gain access to the Internet through a single
                connection by using Dial-Up Networking or local networking.<br /><br />
                <div class="head">WINS (Windows Internet Name Service):</div>
                While DNS resolves host names to IP addresses, WINS resolves
                NetBIOS names to IP addresses. Windows Internet Name Service
                provides a dynamic database of IP address to NetBIOS name
                resolution mappings. WINS, determines the IP address associated
                with a particular network computer. This is called name
                resolution. WINS supports network client and server computers
                running Windows. WINS uses a distributed database that is
                automatically updated with the names of computers currently
                available and the IP address assigned to each one. DNS is an
                alternative for name resolution suitable for network computers
                with fixed IP addresses.

                <div class="head">
                  SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):
                </div>
                Simple Network Management Protocol, is a TCP/IP protocol for
                monitoring networks and network components. SNMP uses small
                utility programs called agents to monitor behavior and traffic
                on the network, in order to gather statistical data. These
                agents can be loaded onto managed devices such as hubs, NIC's,
                servers, routers, and bridges. The gathered data is stored in a
                MIB (management information base). To collect the information in
                a usable form, a management program console polls these agents
                and downloads the information from their MIB's, which then can
                be displayed as graphs, charts and sent to a database program to
                be analyzed.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">NFS (Network File System):</div>
                Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system that
                allows users to access files and directories located on remote
                computers and treat those files and directories as if they were
                local.<br /><br />
                <div class="head">Zeroconf (Zero configuration):</div>
                Zero Configuration Networking is a set of techniques that
                automatically create a usable IP network without configuration
                or special servers. This allows unknowledgeable users to connect
                computers, networked printers, and other items together and
                expect them to work automatically. Without Zeroconf or something
                similar, a knowledgeable user must either set up special
                servers, like DHCP and DNS, or set up each computer's network
                settings manualy.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">SMB (Server Message Block):</div>

                A file-sharing protocol designed to allow networked computers to
                transparently access files that reside on remote systems over a
                variety of networks. The SMB protocol defines a series of
                commands that pass information between computers. SMB uses four
                message types: session control, file, printer, and message<br /><br />
                <div class="head">AFP (Apple File Protocol):</div>

                The file sharing protocol used in an AppleTalk network. In order
                for non-Apple networks to access data in an AppleShare server,
                their protocols must translate into the AFP language. AFP
                versions 3.0 and greater rely exclusively on TCP/IP (port 548 or
                427) for establishing communication, supporting AppleTalk only
                as a service discovery protocol. The AFP 2.x family supports
                both TCP/IP and AppleTalk for communication and service
                discovery.<br /><br />
                <div class="head">LPD (Line Printer Daemon) and Samba:</div>

                LPD is the primary UNIX printing protocol used to submit jobs to
                the printer. The LPR component initiates commands such as "print
                waiting jobs," "receive job," and "send queue state," and the
                LPD component in the print server responds to them. The most
                common implementations of LPD are in the official BSD UNIX
                operating system and the LPRng project. The Common Unix Printing
                System (or CUPS), which is more common on modern Linux
                distributions, borrows heavily from LPD. Unix and Mac OS X
                Servers use the Open Source SAMBA to provide Windows users with
                Server Message Block (SMB) file sharing.<br /><br />

              <h3>
                These are the features of java-<br /><br />

                <div class="head">Object Oriented:</div>

                In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended
                since it is based on the Object model.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Platform Independent:</div>
                Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++,
                when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific
                machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte
                code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual
                Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Simple:</div>

                Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the
                basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Secure:</div>
                With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free,
                tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on
                public-key encryption.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Architecture-neutral:</div>

                Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file
                format, which makes the compiled code executable on many
                processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Portable:</div>

                Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation
                dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The
                compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability
                boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Robust:</div>

                Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by
                emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime
                checking.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Multithreaded:</div>

                With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write
                programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design
                feature allows the developers to construct interactive
                applications that can run smoothly.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Interpreted:</div>

                Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine
                instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process
                is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental
                and light-weight process.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">High Performance:</div>

                With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high
                performance.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Distributed:</div>

                Java is designed for the distributed environment of the
                internet.
                <br /><br />
                <div class="head">Dynamic:</div>

                Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is
                designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can
                carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be
                used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run-time.

                Java Access Specifiers (also known as Visibility Specifiers )
                regulate access to classes, fields and methods in Java.These
                Specifiers determine whether a field or method in a class, can
                be used or invoked by another method in another class or
                sub-class. Access Specifiers can be used to restrict access.
                Access Specifiers are an integral part of object-oriented
                programming.
                <br />
                <br />
                In java we have four Access Specifiers and they are listed
                below:<br />
                1. public<br />
                2. private<br />
                3. protected<br />
                4. default(no specifier)
                <br /><br />
