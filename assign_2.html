                <h3>Advertisers use the framing effect to present information in a manner that influences how viewers interpret that information. Business owners and marketers often employ framing techniques, such as casting a potentially negative fact about their product into a positive light or by showing the negative effects of a competitor's positive qualities. These professionals frame the aspects of an ad and adjust the meaning of its message with tools such as colorful images, strident music and precise language.<br><br>Advertisers are spealist at using language to frame their messages. They understand the emotional  that the consumer have to the specific word. Their goal is to use words that create a positive emotion frame for the product in the viewer's mind.

                  Active Server Pages, commonly referred to as ASP, is Microsoft's solution to server-side scripting. With simple HTML pages, the client (a web surfer) requests a web page from a server (some www.blah.com). The server just sends the file to the client, and the page is shown on the client's browser.
          <br><br>
                  With Active Server Pages, the server gets a chance to alter the file before sending it to the user. So, for every request for a file with a .ASP extension, the server runs the file through a DLL called ASP.DLL, which parses the ASP commands.

                  An XML parser is a software library or package that provides interfaces
                  for client applications to work with an XML document. The XML Parser is
                  designed to read the XML and create a way for programs to use XML.
                  <br /><br />
                  XML parser validates the document and check that the document is well
                  formatted
                  <br /><br />
                  <div class="head"><u>Types of XML Parsers</u>:</div>
                  These are the two main types of XML Parsers:<br />
                  1. DOM <br />
                  2. SAX
                  <br /><br />
          
                  <!-- DOM part -->
                  <div class="head">1. <u>DOM (Document Object Model)</u>:</div>
                  A DOM document is an object which contains all the information of an XML
                  document. It is composed like a tree structure. The DOM Parser
                  implements a DOM API. This API is very simple to use.<br /><br />
                  A DOM Parser creates an internal structure in memory which is a DOM
                  document object and the client applications get information of the
                  original XML document by invoking methods on this document object.
                  <br /><br />
                  DOM Parser has a tree based structure.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b><u>Advantages:</u></b
                  ><br />
                  1) It supports both read and write operations and the API is very simple
                  to use.<br />
                  2) It is preferred when random access to widely separated parts of a
                  document is required.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b><u>Disadvantages:</u></b
                  ><br />
                  1) It is memory inefficient. (consumes more memory because the whole XML
                  document needs to loaded into memory).
                  <br />
                  2) It is comparatively slower than other parsers.
                  <br /><br />
          
                  <!-- SOM part -->
                  <div class="head">2. <u>SAX (Simple API for XML)</u>:</div>
                  A SAX Parser implements SAX API. This API is an event based API and less
                  intuitive.<br /><br />
                  It does not create any internal structure.
                  <br /><br />
                  Clients does not know what methods to call, they just overrides the
                  methods of the API and place his own code inside method.
                  <br /><br />
                  It is an event based parser, it works like an event handler in Java.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b><u>Advantages:</u></b
                  ><br />
                  1) It is simple and memory efficient.<br />
                  2) It is very fast and works for huge documents.
                  <br /><br />
                  <b><u>Disadvantages:</u></b
                  ><br />
                  1) It is event-based so its API is less intuitive.<br />
                  2) Clients never know the full information because the data is broken
                  into pieces.
