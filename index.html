        ANSWER:&ensp;The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government
        researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and
        immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one
        computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have
        magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.
        <br /><br />
        January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet.
        Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way
        to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was
        established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol
        (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different
        networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network
        officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the
        birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a
        universal language..

        The image above is a scale model of the UNIVAC I (the name stood for
        Universal Automatic Computer) which was delivered to the Census Bureau
        in 1951. It weighed some 16,000 pounds, used 5,000 vacuum tubes, and
        could perform about 1,000 calculations per second. It was the first
        American commercial computer, as well as the first computer designed for
        business use. (Business computers like the UNIVAC processed data more
        slowly than the IAS-type machines, but were designed for fast input and
        output.) The first few sales were to government agencies, the A.C.
        Nielsen Company, and the Prudential Insurance Company. The first UNIVAC
        for business applications was installed at the General Electric
        Appliance Division, to do payroll, in 1954. By 1957 Remington-Rand
        (which had purchased the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1950)
        had sold forty-six machines.

      <h3>QUESTION:&ensp; Discuss the functions of different protocols.</h3>

      <h3>
        ANSWER:<br /><br />
        <div class="head">Object Oriented:</div>

        In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it
        is based on the Object model.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Platform Independent:</div>
        Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java
        is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather
        into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over
        the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever
        platform it is being run on.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Simple:</div>

        Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic
        concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Secure:</div>
        With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
        systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Architecture-neutral:</div>

        Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format,
        which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the
        presence of Java runtime system.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Portable:</div>

        Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent
        aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The compiler in Java
        is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX
        subset.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Robust:</div>

        Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing
        mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Multithreaded:</div>

        With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that
        can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the
        developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Interpreted:</div>

        Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions
        and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and
        analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">High Performance:</div>

        With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Distributed:</div>

        Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="head">Dynamic:</div>

        Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed
        to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry an
        extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and
        resolve accesses to objects at run-time.
